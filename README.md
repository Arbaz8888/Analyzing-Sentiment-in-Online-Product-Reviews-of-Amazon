# Sentiment Analysis in Online Product Reviews - Amazon

## Problem Statement
Online product reviews on platforms like Amazon provide a wealth of information that can be harnessed to understand customer sentiments. This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews to extract valuable insights into customer opinions and satisfaction.

## Background
Understanding the sentiment behind customer reviews is crucial for businesses to enhance their products and services. The background of this project explores the significance of sentiment analysis in the context of online reviews and its impact on business decision-making.

## References
To ensure a robust analysis, relevant references related to sentiment analysis, natural language processing (NLP), and methodologies for analyzing online reviews were consulted. This section provides a foundation for the chosen approach.

## Random Forest Algorithm Model
The project incorporates the Random Forest algorithm as a machine-learning model to classify sentiments in Amazon product reviews. This section details the implementation and workings of the Random Forest model.

## Creating Features using Count Vectors and TF-IDF
Text data often needs to be transformed into a numerical format for machine learning algorithms. This project utilizes Count Vectors and TF-IDF to convert textual data into a format suitable for analysis, facilitating a deeper understanding of the reviews.

## Approach - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are employed to address the complexity of human language in the sentiment analysis process. This section outlines the NLP approach used to extract meaningful information from the reviews.

## Logistic Regression Model
In addition to the Random Forest model, this project also implements Logistic Regression to further analyze and classify sentiments in Amazon product reviews. The section provides insights into the workings of the Logistic Regression model.

## Feature Engineering Methods
Feature engineering is a crucial aspect of machine learning. This project explores various feature engineering methods, including custom feature extraction, to enhance the model's ability to discern sentiment nuances in the text data.

## Results & Evaluation
The section delves into the results obtained from both the Random Forest and Logistic Regression models. Visualizations such as word clouds, bar graphs, curves, and confusion matrices are presented to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of the models.

### Key Findings:
- Word clouds visually represent frequently occurring terms in positive and negative reviews.
- Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 0.92 using TF-IDF ngram, while Random Forest achieved 0.88.

## Conclusion
Drawing conclusions based on the obtained results, this section summarizes the key findings and insights derived from the sentiment analysis of Amazon product reviews.

## Techniques for Advanced Sentiment Analysis
An exploration of advanced techniques employed in sentiment analysis is provided, encompassing text preprocessing, NLP-driven feature creation (Count Vectors, TF-IDF), and model development using logistic regression and random forest.

## Key Insights
This section highlights the importance of evaluating model performance and conducting in-depth analyses of feature importance to derive valuable insights into the key elements driving sentiment analysis conclusions.
